# ITWS-2110-F25
Fall 2025 Web Systems Repository

At first, I was completely lost on how I should start working on this webpage since I've never worked with API's before. I wasn't entirely sure how
to even use the API keys even though I listened to the professor explain everything. I had to look at some examples like the facebook link from the slides. 
At some point, I just started working on the webpage and decided I'd worry about working with the API's later since the actual webpage is really simple. It only consists of a couple boxes and some colors that needed to be rearranged. I used some AI to help me with the gradient because I always thought it was cool to have, but couldn't find anywhere that explained exactly what I wanted to implement. Once I finished the webpage and the css, I started writing the script for the API's after watching a few videos like the one I linked. I also used this github repository that had a ton of API links to use when I was deciding what API to use. I ended up using the useless facts API since I was being indecisive. Overall I think the lab took me like 5 hours including the amount of time I got distracted by my phone and trying to figure out how the javascript even worked. I can confidently say that I have a decent understanding of what to do and that I could redo this lab in half the time if I had to redo it.
