For the menu data, I decided it should be loaded asynchronously using XMLHttpRequest to fetch the menu.json file. Once received, JSON.parse() converts the JSON string into a JavaScript object, and the code loops through each dish in the array. For each dish, the script dynamically creates HTML table row elements and populates cells with the dish properties, then appends them to the table body to display the complete menu.

For the design choice, I chose a blue and grey gradient color scheme after looking at some references and being indecisive. I made color-coded badges for quick visual categorization like blue for cuisines, green for vegetarian/vegan, and orange for non-vegetarian dishes. I also wanted to make the cards responsive so that the website feels more interactive rather than just a static menu that you are reading off of even though you still are.
