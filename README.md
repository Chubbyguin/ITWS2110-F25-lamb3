Overall, I think this assignment took about 5-6 hours total. At the beginning, I completely forgot how to start the assignment, so I had to reference my old work to start and from there, all the memory of doing this came back. It was mostly smooth sailing from there. I never really had any issues, but I had ideas that I didn't know how to bring to life like the shadows behind the sections and making things responsive to being hovered. The sources below are what I used to remember how to properly format some stuff, and I used some AI to figure out how to properly align some text using align center and justify center. I'm still not 100% sure what the differences are, so that's why I used it. As I use it more, I'll probably understand it better and be able to just use it off the top of my head.
